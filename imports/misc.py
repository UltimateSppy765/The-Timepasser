Eventually, they made a server where they brought some people. They tried to make it active and needed many sources for that. One source was making their own server bot. And as the name of the server was **':beginner:â”‚The Timepass Squad'** (which they took 2 days to decide), they made me: **'The Timepasser'**! In process of my making, they even took help from a friend for testing things.
